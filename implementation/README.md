## How To Run the Application

Here you can find a series of steps to run this application.

1. Clone the repository:
    - Ensure you have git installed by running `git version`
        - If nothing is returned, then you must install git. How to do this varies by OS. The official documentation for how to install git can be found [**here**](https://git-scm.com/install/)
        - If git is installed, then running `git version` will display the current version of git in the command line interface (CLI). 
    - Find a location in your file manager that you would like to clone the project to, and navigate to it using your CLI.
    - To clone the repository, run the command `git clone https://github.com/copelansam/swe-3313-fall-2025-team-08`. This will create a local copy of the application that you can run on your machine.
2. Build the Project:
    - In order to run the application, you will need to ensure that you have maven installed.
    - To check if maven is installed, run `mvn -v` in your CLI.
      - If you receive an error message, then maven is not installed.
