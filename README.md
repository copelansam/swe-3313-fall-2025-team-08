## Introduction
***
Repository for Fall 2025 SWE 3313 Section 04 Group Project for Team 8 - The Peanut Gallery

Welcome to the project repository for Team 8 - The Peanut Gallery. Here you will find all of the artifacts, presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 class project.

We will create a small e-commerce website that sells artwork using Java, Spring, and SQLite to sell one of a kind artwork

## Requirements
***

Upon meeting with our client, we were able to define the functionalities, features, and processes required for the project to be successful.
<br>
We defined the functionality for an online artwork store that supports account creation and management, inventory searching, and secure checkout. Users can create and log into accounts, add unique artwork to their carts, and complete purchases. Admins have additional permissions allowing them to add additional inventory to the site, run and export sales reports, and manage user accounts.
<br><br>

## User Interface Design
***

To help demonstrate what we are trying to make, we have created a high-fidelity mockup of our UI.<br> 
A link to our mockup can be found here: [**High Fidelity User Interface Design (Marvel)**](https://marvelapp.com/prototype/11de22fh/screen/98008311) <br>
A presentation that goes over the UI mockup can be found [**here**](https://www.loom.com/share/eade212c70f94347bf63d2588882e579)

## Technical Design
***
We have created a few artifacts that describe how we will build the system including the chosen language and framework, 
the entities and classes present within our system, and the coding conventions that all programmers will follow.
<br> A link to our Technical Design can be found below:<br>

## Final Presentation 
***
Here you can view presentations that go over using the application and how it differs from our original idea.
- [Compiling and Using the Application As a User](https://www.loom.com/share/e42fbdb4f1d84b518829d06ef99fab25)
- [Admin User Experience and How the Project Differs from Our Original Design](https://www.loom.com/share/ce727973322b4794a9af10114d168a23)
<br>**NOTE:** A difference that was not mentioned in the second video is that we changed all of the items in the item table to
be in stock. This is because we realized that it didn't really make sense to have items in our project that were not available if they were not part of an order.

## AI Acknowledgement
***
**NOTE:** Portions of this project were made with the assistance of an AI tool (ChatGPT).
<br>The AI was used to help us understand some of the more abstract concepts that were introduced to us as a part of the course and project.
<br>Some examples of prompts that would have been used during this project include:
- "How does an MVC architecture work?"
- "I'm planning on creating a project with Spring Boot, using the initializer that can be found here: https://start.spring.io/, what dependencies should I add to my project?"
- "Where can I find good documentation regarding programming language X?"
- "What are Spring Boot annotations and how do they work?"

<br>The  use of AI tools is encouraged more for assisting with the learning process and helping to explain abstract concepts than for the actual coding effort.
<br>In the event that an AI tool is used to generate something for this project, it should be properly cited.
<br>**NOTE:** The folder structure under the 'source' folder was made under the suggestion of ChatGPT after being reviewed by the team. 
Additional uses of AI will be cited in line as they occur.
