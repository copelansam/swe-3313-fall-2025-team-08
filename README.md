## Requirements
***

After meeting with our client, we were able to determine their required functionalities, features, and processes necessary for the project to be successful.

We defined the functionality for an online artwork store that supports account creation, inventory searching, and secure checkout. Users can create accounts, log in, and add unique artwork to their cart, and complete purchases. Admins have additional permissions including promoting users, adjusting inventory, and accessing sales report.
