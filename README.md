## Requirements
***

Upon meeting with our client, we were able to define the functionalities, features, and processes required for the project to be successful.
<br>
We defined the functionality for an online artwork store that supports account creation and management, inventory searching, and secure checkout. Users can create and log into accounts, add unique artwork to their carts, and complete purchases. Admins have additional permissions allowing them to add additional inventory to the site, run and export sales reports, and manage user accounts.
