# Technology Selection
***

## Implementation Language
***
 - We have chosen to use Java as our programming language due to our group's familiarity with Java
 - Official documentation for Java can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
 - Additional documentation can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_ref_reference.asp)

## Implementation Framework
***
 - We have chosen to use Spring as our implementation framework due to it being an open-source framework commonly used in java projects <br>
 - The source that we will be using to help implement Spring can be found [here](https://start.spring.io/)
 - The official documentation for Spring can be found [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/index.html)

## Storage Mechanism
***
 - We plan to use SQLite as our storage mechanism since SQL is taught by Kennesaw State University early on in its curriculum
 - The official documentation for SQLite can be found [here](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)
